            "content": "3.13 Developing Procedures: . What is a procedure: . A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. It is a group of code that serves a purpose. | Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . | Developing a procedure: What questions do I need to ask myself? . What am I going to name my procedure? (It should reflect the purpose of the code) | What parameters do I need? | What data would I need to take in to accomplish my goal? | Do I want my procedure to give a numerical value, or complete an action? | . | . In this example, what is the name of the procedure, what are the paramters, and what does the procedure return? . a = 10 b = 200 def multiplication(a, b): product = a * b return product answer = multiplication(a, b) print(a, &quot;x&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, answer) . 10 x 200 = 2000 . What is procedural abstraction? . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. Have variable parameters | Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called | It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. | . | Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality is called modularity* | . What is a benefit of using procedures? . We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program | Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity) able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. | MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line) | . | . Here is an example of modularity and the benefits of procedures. Which is better? This is not any particulur language, but it helps us understand why procedures are beneficial . Say a object is moving across a grid and wants to get to the finish line. This is what the object is doing: . rotate_left() | move_forward() | rotate_right() | move_forward() | rotate_right() | move_forward() | rotate_left() | move_forward() | move_forward() | . Say the object doesn&#39;t end up at the finish line. It is going to be a pain to individually look at every line and see what to fix (of course, in this example, it wouldn&#39;t be that bad, but we&#39;re assuming that it will be much longer). . This is where procedures come in handy. . We can split up the code into differnet motions. . rotate_left() | move_forward() | rotate_right() | move_forward() | rotate_right() | move_forward() | . We can call this whole segment detourRight() . rotate_left() | move_forward() | move_forward() | . And we can call this turnCorner() . Seperating the long code into two different procedures allows us to individually point at what might have gone wrong during the process and is therefore essential to coders. . 3.12: Calling Procedures . A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called | . A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statments. . A procedure MAY or MAY NOT return a value (a number or boolean (true or false)). . When it doesn&#39;t, we just use the procedure name along with arguments. | . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure (there may not be parameters, but parenthesis must be there) . In order to determine what the result of a procedure is, you need to carefully examine the code line by line . What if a procedure DOES return a number or boolean? . In this case, when we call the procedure, we are going to assign that to a variable. Before we call a procedure, we need to know what kind of procedure we&#39;re dealing with. . | We need to know if the procedure requires arguments and what type of data the procedure will return . | . Lets look at a few simple examples . What is the procedure name, the paramters, and the result of the procedure? . def square(x): # the procedure is defined with the parameter being x return x*x # x is multiplied by x print(square(4)) # the 4 becomes the argument . 16 . def multiplyNum(num): # procedure is defined with the parameter num return num * 8 # num will be multipled by 8 result = multiplyNum(8) # 8 becomes the num; afterwards, 8 is multiplied by 8 to become 64. print(result) . 64 . a = 10 b = 6.7 def subNumbers(x,y): # procedure is defined with paramters x and y return (x-y) # here, the result calls the procedure subNumbers and tells the procedure to subtract a and b. result = subNumbers(a, b) # afterwards, it prints here print(a, &quot;-&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, result) . 10 - 6.7 = 3.3 . Challenge 1 Let&#39;s try an example with a decimal to binary convertor. Please take time to create a conversion to from decimal to binary and call the procedure and print. | . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): (decimal) print() .
