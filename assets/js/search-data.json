            "content": "3.13 Developing Procedures: . What is a procedure: . A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. It is a group of code that serves a purpose. | Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . | Developing a procedure: What questions do I need to ask myself? . What am I going to name my procedure? (It should reflect the purpose of the code) | What parameters do I need? | What data would I need to take in to accomplish my goal? | Do I want my procedure to give a numerical value, or complete an action? | . | . What is procedural abstraction? . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. Have variable parameters | Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called | It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. | . | The subdivision of a computer program into seperate subprograms is called modularity | . What is a benefit of using procedures? . We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program | Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity) able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. | MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line) | . | . We&#39;re going to look at another robot example from collegeboard soon. This is just an example to show how helpful it is to have procedures. When you are looking back at this code months later, which side would be easier to see? . 3.12: Calling Procedures . A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called | . A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statments. . A procedure MAY or MAY NOT return a value (a number or boolean (true or false)). . When it doesn&#39;t, we just use the procedure name along with arguments. | . Let&#39;s look at an example of a procedure from collegeboard that does not return a number . Take a minute to determine the position of where the robot will end up. | . What if a procedure DOES return a number or boolean? . In this case, when we call the procedure, we are going to assign that to a variable. Before we call a procedure, we need to know what kind of procedure we&#39;re dealing with. . | We need to know if the procedure requires arguments and what type of data the procedure will return . | . Lets look at a few simple examples . def square(x): # the procedure is defined with the parameter being x return x*x # x is multiplied by x print(square(4)) # the 4 becomes the argument . 16 . def multiplyNum(num): # procedure is defined with the parameter num return num * 8 # num will be multipled by 8 result = multiplyNum(8) # 8 becomes the num; afterwards, 8 is multiplied by 8 to become 64. print(result) . 64 . a = 10 b = 6.7 def subNumbers(x,y): # procedure is defined with paramters x and y return (x-y) # here, the result calls the procedure subNumbers and tells the procedure to subtract a and b. result = subNumbers(a, b) # afterwards, it prints here print(a, &quot;-&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, result) . 10 - 6.7 = 3.3 . Challenge 1 Let&#39;s try an example with a decimal to binary convertor. Please take time to create a conversion to from decimal to binary and call the procedure and print. | . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): (decimal) print() .
