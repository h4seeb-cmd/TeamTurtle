Instructions to Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(n): (decimal) print() . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def charToBinary(x):() # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get . &#39;&#39;APCSP&#39;&#39; in binary is [1000001, 1010000, 1000011, 1010011, 1010000] .",

            "content": "3.12 Essential Vocab: . A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values | Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language | Parameters are input values of a procedure. | Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called | . A procedure MAY (a number or boolean (true or false)) or MAY NOT return a value. . When it doesn’t, we just use the procedure name along with arguments. That’s it. | . Let’s look at an example of a procedure that does not return a number with Pseudo Code . . Take a minute to determine where the robot will end up with your group. | . Here is another example . What if a procedure DOES return a number or boolean? . In this case, when we call the procedure, we are going to assign that to a variable. It’s slightly more complicated, but not that bad. Before we call a procedure, we need to know what kind of procedure we’re dealing with. . | We need to know if the procedure requires arguments and what type of data the procedure will return (numbers or no numbers, for example). . | Example 1 Let’s try an example with a decimal to binary convertor. Please go to your notetaker and add the command that will call the procedure. . | . 3.13 Essential Knowledge: . Creating a procedure; What questions do I need to ask myself? What am I going to name my procedure? It should reflect the purpose of the code | . | What parameters do I need? What data would I need to take in to accomplish my goal? | . | . | . ADD AN EXAMPLE OF DEVELOPING A PROCEDURE HERE . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. | It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. | The subdivision of a computer program into seperate subprograms is called modularity. . | What is a benefit of using procedures We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program | Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity) able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. | MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line) | . | . | .",
