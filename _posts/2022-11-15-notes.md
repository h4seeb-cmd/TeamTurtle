# 3.12 Essential Vocab: 
- A ***Procedure*** is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values 
- Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language
- ***Parameters*** are input values of a procedure. 
- ***Arguments*** specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called

A procedure MAY (a number or boolean (true or false)) or MAY NOT return a value. 

- When it **doesn't**, we just use the procedure name along with arguments. That's it. 

Let's look at an example of a procedure that does not return a number with Pseudo Code

- The robot follows the code on the left, then once it gets to detourRight, it calls the procedure on the right and follows those steps. 

- Take a minute to determine where the robot will end up with your group.

What if a procedure **DOES** return a number or boolean?

- In this case, when we call the procedure, we are going to assign that to a variable. It's slightly more complicated, but not that bad. Before we call a procedure, we need to know what kind of procedure we're dealing with.

- We need to know if the procedure requires arguments and what type of data the procedure will return (numbers or no numbers, for example). 

- <mark>Example 1</mark> Let's try an example with a decimal to binary convertor. Please go to your notetaker and add the command that will call the procedure. 


# 3.13 Essential Knowledge: 
-  Creating a procedure; What questions do I need to ask myself? 
    - What am I going to name my procedure? 
        - It should reflect the purpose of the code
    - What parameters do I need?
        - What data would I need to take in to accomplish my goal?

ADD AN EXAMPLE OF DEVELOPING A PROCEDURE HERE 

- One type of abstraction is ***procedural abstraction***, which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. 
- It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. 
- The subdivision of a computer program into seperate subprograms is called ***modularity***. 

- What is a benefit of using procedures
    - We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program
    - Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity)
        - able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. 
        - MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line)
