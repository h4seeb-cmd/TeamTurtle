# 3.12 Essential Knowledge: 
- A ***Procedure*** is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values 
- Procedures can also be referred as method or function, depending on language
- ***Parameters*** are input values of a procedure. 
- ***Arguments*** specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called

A procedure MAY (a number or boolean (true or false)) or MAY NOT return a value. 

Here is the exam reference sheet when a procedure does not return a value

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/refsheet1.png)

Here, we just use the procedure name along with arguments. That's it. 

Here is an example of a procedure that does not return a number

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ex1.png)

The arrow follows the code on the left, then once it gets to detourRight, it calls the procedure on the right and follows those steps.

# What if a procedure DOES return a number or boolean?

Here is the exam reference sheet when a procedure does return a value

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/refsheet2.png)

Here, when we call the procedure, we are going to assign that to a variable. It's slightly more complicated, but not that bad. Before we call a procedure, we need to know what kind of procedure we're dealing with. We need to know if the procedure requires arguments and what type of data the procedure will return (numbers or no numbers, for example). Let's try an example with a decimal to binary convertor. Please go to your notetaker and add the command that will call the procedure. 















# 3.13
- One common type of abstraction is procedural abstraction, which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does, not how it does it. It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. 
- The subdivision of a computer program into seperate subprograms is called ***modularity***
-  Creating a procedure; What questions do I need to ask myself? 
    - What am I going to name my procedure? 
        - It should reflect the purpose of the code
    - What parameters do I need?
        - What data would I need to take in to accomplish my goal?
- What is a benefit of using procedures
    - We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program (for example, rounding; remember the grade rounding example from 3.13 video 2)
    - Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity)
        - able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. 
        - MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line)
